# SF-40 Python SLAM

## Work in Progress

This script will open a .xyz file, and using the Open3D python library, integrate multiple point clouds into one large point cloud representing the overall scene. 

This script can currently only process data that has already been collected and saved, but I am working to add a functionality that will allow it to process a stream of data and have a live-updating point cloud map. 

## Requirements:
Open3d currently requires Python 3.10 or less.

# SF-40 Driver

## Work in Progress

## Acknowledgement
This script was written using Lightware's [SF-45 binary protocol python sample](https://github.com/LightWare-Optoelectronics/SampleLibrary/blob/master/binary%20protocol/sf45_python/sf45_python.py) as a rough template. 

## Functionality
Using PyQtGraph, this script can give a live visualization of the LiDAR data, indicating the relative positions of any objects sensed by the SF-40.

This script will save the LiDAR data as a point cloud in the .xyz format, and can be processed later. I am currently working on some changes that would allow for processing the live data stream.
